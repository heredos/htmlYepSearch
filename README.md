# htmlYepSearch
a php wrapper that queries the yep search api to provide results for low-end devices

# THIS PROJECT IS BROKEN!
ahrefs recently made some changes to that search api, i probably already know how to bypass them, it doesn't look very hard, but annoying enough that i want to spend my already very limited spare time on something else in the near future.  
also, i am cooking a follow up to it after i discovered something else, something very interesting, anpther unprotected yep endpoint, i'll share it soon enough, i hope.
  
please note that this project in not affiliated with nor endorsed by the ahrefs team or the yep team.  
it is using an unoficial endpoint that was left open and unprotected by cloudflare. Don't expect me to try and bypass cloudflare if they ever remove this access, i think that would be entering a grey legal area.

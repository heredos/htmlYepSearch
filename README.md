a php wrapper that queries the yep search api to provide results for low-end devices
  
please note that this project in not affiliated with nor endorsed by the ahrefs team or the yep team.  
it is using an unoficial endpoint that was left open and unprotected by cloudflare. Don't expect me to try and bypass cloudflare if they ever remove this access, i think that would be entering a grey legal area.

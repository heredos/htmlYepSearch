# THIS PROJECT IS (sometimes) BROKEN?
ahrefs is apparently doing some testing and this project is sometimes broken, and sometimes not?
no idea what's happening, but whatever, this is not meant to be a reliable service, more of a fun toy to browse the web from my ereader
  
please note that this project in not affiliated with nor endorsed by the ahrefs team or the yep team.  
it is using an unoficial endpoint that was left open and unprotected by cloudflare. Don't expect me to try and bypass cloudflare if they ever remove this access, i think that would be entering a grey legal area.
